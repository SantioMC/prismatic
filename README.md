# Prismatic

A rust-based generic discord bot

</div>

> **Note**: This project is the first bigish project I've worked on in rust, so keep in mind this project's code is probably the worst rust code you've ever seen. I'm still learning, so if you can provide any feedback, please do so!

## Running the bot

To run the bot, first build a production build of the project, this requires you to have [rust](https://rust-lang.org) installed. Once you have rust installed, run the following command:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Once you have built the project, you can run the bot by running using the following command:

```bash
./target/release/prismatic
```

_A more in depth readme will be made once more features are added to the bot, this project is currently purely a learning experience and could be on pause at any time or abandoned at any time._
